# GPA-Prediction-using-Simple-Linear-Regression-Python-Model
This project uses a simple linear regression model to predict a student's GPA based on their SAT score and attendance rate. 
The project is implemented in Python using various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Statsmodels.

## Data
The project uses two datasets: 1.01. Simple linear regression.csv and 1.03. Dummies.csv. The 1.01. Simple linear regression.csv file contains data on 84 students, including their SAT scores and GPAs. The 1.03. Dummies.csv file contains similar data but also includes a binary variable indicating whether a student attended more than 75% of their lectures.
