# GPA-Prediction-using-Simple-Linear-Regression-Python-Model
This project uses a simple linear regression model to predict a student's GPA based on their SAT score and attendance rate. 
The project is implemented in Python using various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Statsmodels.

## Data
The project uses two datasets: 1.01. Simple linear regression.csv and 1.03. Dummies.csv. The 1.01. Simple linear regression.csv file contains data on 84 students, including their SAT scores and GPAs. The 1.03. Dummies.csv file contains similar data but also includes a binary variable indicating whether a student attended more than 75% of their lectures.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following libraries to be installed:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Statsmodels
Seaborn
These libraries can be installed using pip by running the following command:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib statsmodels seaborn

## Usage
To use this project, simply run the Simple_Linear_Regression_Model.ipynb Jupyter Notebook file. The file contains code for data exploration, regression analysis, and predictions.
